## üìê Architecture Models

<p>
An architecture model is a partial abstraction of a system. It is an approximation, and it captures the different properties of the system. It is a scaled-down version and is built with all the essential details of the system. Architecture modeling involves identifying the characteristics of the system and expressing it as models so that the system can be understood. Architecture models allow visualization of information about the system represented by the model. The modeling process can be bottom up/inside out, by which details of the system are built utilizing knowledge about components and interconnections and how they compose together to realize the characteristics of the system. Alternatively, it can be top-down/outside in, by which details of the components and interconnections are extracted from knowledge of the whole. For the time study illustration, an architecture model is illustrated in Figure
