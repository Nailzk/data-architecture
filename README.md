## üìê Architecture Models

<p>
An architecture model is a partial abstraction of a system. It is an approximation, and it captures the different properties of the system. It is a scaled-down version and is built with all the essential details of the system. Architecture modeling involves identifying the characteristics of the system and expressing it as models so that the system can be understood. Architecture models allow visualization of information about the system represented by the model. The modeling process can be bottom up/inside out, by which details of the system are built utilizing knowledge about components and interconnections and how they compose together to realize the characteristics of the system. Alternatively, it can be top-down/outside in, by which details of the components and interconnections are extracted from knowledge of the whole. For the time study illustration, an architecture model is illustrated in Figure

## üõ∏ OOP Paradigm

<p>
The major motivating factor in the invention of object-oriented approch is to remove some of the flaws encountered in the procedural approch. OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the systems. It ties data more closely to the functions that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from outside functions. OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and functions around these objects. The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with that object. However, functions of one object can access the the functions of other objects.

## ‚åõ Data Flow Architecture

<p>
Dataflow programming (DFP) introduces a new programming paradigm that
internally represents applications as a directed graph, similarly to a dataflow
diagram. Applications are represented as a set of nodes (also called blocks) with
input and/or output ports in them. These nodes can either be sources, sinks or
processing blocks to the information flowing in the system. Nodes are connected
by directed edges that define the flow of information between them. Most visual
programming languages that use a block-based architecture for representing their
workflow are indeed based on DFP .Several advantages are inherited with such
model, as presented in this paper.

## üè¨ Data Centered Architecture

<p>
An information focused architecture, the information is concentrated and gotten to every now and again by different parts, which alter information. The fundamental motivation behind this style is to accomplish integrality of information. Information focused architecture comprises of various parts that convey through shared information vaults. The segments get to a common information structure and are generally free, in that, they associate just through the information store.

The most surely understood cases of the information focused design is a database architecture, in which the regular database construction is made with information definition convention ‚Äì for instance, an arrangement of related tables with fields and information types in a RDBMS.
Another case of information focused structures is the web architecture which has a typical information composition (i.e. meta-structure of the Web) and takes after hypermedia information model and procedures impart using shared online information administrations.
